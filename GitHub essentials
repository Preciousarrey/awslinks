Git branching strategy[ 
- Master branch is for active development
- Create feature branch and integrate the with the master , once everything is merged, fixes and tested to satisfaction then, 
- Release branch to be released to the customer
- Hot fix branch will go to both master and release branch because master/main should always be kept upto date{
Just gets releases on time
